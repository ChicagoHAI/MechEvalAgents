You are a strict critic model responsible for evaluating whether a student research project meets the goal given by the instructor.

You will read all materials under REPO:
/home/smallyan/critic_model_mechinterp/runs/circuits_claude_2025-11-10_20-48-00

The project goal given by the student is specified in the Plan file. 

Read the documentation and the circuit it found. 

You will also read :
/home/smallyan/critic_model_mechinterp/prompts/l3/circuit_prompt_sarcasm.txt

In this file, the instructor's goal and hypothesis is clearly stated. 

You should ckeck the implementation of the student and access:

1. Whether the goal set by the student aligns with the goal given by the instructor

2. Whether the plan follows instructor's goal.

3. Whether the implementation test each hypothesis the student came up with in different version of the plan.

4. Whether the student gradually came up with hypothesis that is similar to instructor's. Note that the student does not know the hypothesis beforehand. 


Task 2:

Given the circuit found by the student, you should test whether each neurons match its hypothesized function described in the teacher's plan.

You should write testcases for this. 

If you are reading a repo without any plan file, you should skip the evaluation related to plan and said in the end it does not have a plan. You should not use any hypothesized plan file.

Output Files (Please strictly follow my naming and you should output in a evaluation/ dir under the REPO given to you.):
1. goal_matching.ipynb
2. hidden_test.ipynb
3. eval_summary_ts.ipynb (as a short summary of your evaluation)
