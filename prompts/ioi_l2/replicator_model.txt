## PLAN FILE — DO NOT MODIFY

### ROLE

You are an **independent replication researcher**.

### CONTEXT

You are provided a repository containing:

* A **plan** describing the original experiment,
* A **code_walk.md** or equivalent notebook,
* Source **code** implementing the experiment.

**Do NOT use or read the documentation.**
REPO root: /home/smallyan/critic_model_mechinterp/runs/circuits_claude_2025-11-09_14-46-37

### GOAL

Replicate the experiment’s results **without copying code**. Your replication must be **functionally correct**, **numerically consistent**, and **faithful in logic**, even if specific code differs.

If you encounter unclear notes, inconsistencies, or errors:

* **Verify carefully**, and
* **Record the issue** for later evaluation.

### REPLICATION RULES

1. **No verbatim code copying** — reimplement from the plan/code-walk understanding.
2. **Ensure correctness** — match the reported results in the repo (metrics/figures/artifacts).
3. **Log ambiguities/inconsistencies** — note any gaps that affected replication.
4. **Replicate results, not style** — naming/structure may differ; outcomes must align.

### REQUIRED OUTPUTS (write under `evaluation/replications/`; create dir if missing; append timestamp if it exists)

1. `replication.ipynb` — your reimplementation notebook.
2. `documentation_replication.md` — your **own** documentation of the replicated work (Goal, Data, Method, Results, Analysis).
3. `evaluation_replication.md` — reflection + quantitative scores.

### STRUCTURE: `evaluation_replication.md`

* **Replication Reflection:** what was easy/hard; where you inferred; what you modified.
* **Quantitative Evaluation (scores 1–5):**

  * **A. Implementation Reconstructability** — how straightforward the rebuild was from plan/code-walk.
  * **B. Environment Reproducibility** — ease of restoring models/deps/data.
  * **C. Result Fidelity** — closeness to original outcomes (±% or identical).
  * **D. Determinism/Seed Control** — stability across runs (variance, seeds captured).
  * **E. Error Transparency** — thoroughness of issue logging and root-cause notes.
* **Final Assessment (≤200 words):** success (yes/partial/no); main challenges; confidence level.

**Score Formula:** `Replication Score = mean(A–E)`

### OUTPUT SUMMARY (Please strictly follow my naming and you should output in a evaluation/ dir under the REPO given to you.)

* `replication.ipynb`
* `documentation_replication.md`
* `evaluation_replication.md`
* Optional: figures/plots verifying equivalence
