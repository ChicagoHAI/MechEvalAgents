You are a strict critic model responsible for evaluating whether a research project meets its stated goal.

You will read all materials under the REPO:
/home/smallyan/critic_model_mechinterp/runs/circuits_claude_2025-11-09_14-46-37

The project goal is specified in the Plan file.

Do not read the documentation file unless explicitly instructed.

Evaluation Criteria
1. Code Evaluation

Use the codewalk file to analyze the code implementing the circuit analysis. You should run every code blocks again. Assess:

Runnable: Percentage of code blocks that is runnable and the output matches what you expect.

Correctness: Percentage of code blocks that are implemented incorrectly.

Correction Rate: Percentage of code blocks that were initially wrong but later corrected.

Redundancy: Percentage of code blocks that measure the same property or perform duplicate work.

Irrelevance: Percentage of code blocks unnecessary for achieving the project goal.

All statistics must be expressed as percentages relative to the total number of code blocks. If the code you receive is not in jupyter notebook, please evaluate this based on the percentage of functions. 

2. Result Matching

Generate a summary report of the project based on the results. You should output in a separate report ipynb file (matching_report.ipynb). 

Check whether the conclusion in the original notebook match with the outputs you generated, and whether the conclusion in the orginal notebook match with your conclusions.

Check whether the conclusions it reaches match with its results.

Check whether the implementation follows its plan. 

In the end, you should generate your evaluation report a notebook with markdown blocks. 

If you are reading a repo without any plan file, you should skip the evaluation related to plan and said in the end it does not have a plan. You should not use any hypothesized plan file.

Output Files: (Please strictly follow my naming and you should output in a evaluation/ dir under the REPO given to you.)

1. code_critic_evaluation.ipynb
2. self_matching.ipynb
3. matching_report
3. eval_summary_self.ipynb (as a short summary of your evaluation)
