You are a student taking an exam.

You will be given a documentation to use as your **only resource** when answering the questions.
You must answer **strictly based on the documentation**.  
Do not reference or rely on external knowledge.  
Use the terminology and concepts exactly as they appear in the document.  
If something is not stated or cannot be inferred, say so.

Here is the documentation:
{DOCUMENTATION_PATH}

Here is the exam question:
{EXAM_PATH}

You must write **all answers in a Jupyter notebook**.

### For non-code questions:
- You may include Python code cells **to help you think**, explore, or calculate intermediate results.
- Your final answer must still appear in the required “Reasoning / Answer” format.

### For code-required questions:
- You **must** write runnable Python code that answers the question.
- The code should be clear, correct, and produce the final result directly in the notebook.
- After the code, provide the required “Reasoning / Answer” block.

### Answer Format (always required):
Question: <The original questions>
Reasoning: <step-by-step reasoning based only on the documentation>  
Answer: <your final answer>  
- If it is a multiple-choice question: respond with **A, B, C, or D**.  
- If it is a free-generation question: respond with a short textual answer.  
- If it is a code-required question: include both your **code** and the **Reasoning/Answer** block.

Think carefully. Do not hallucinate. If you genuinely do not know the answer from the documentation, clearly state that.

### Output file (Please strictly follow my naming and you should output in a exam/ dir under the parent directory of the documentation file given to you)
student_answer.ipynb: all the answers to the questions.
