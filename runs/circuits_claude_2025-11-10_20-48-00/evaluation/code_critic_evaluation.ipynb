      "### Success Criteria\n",
      "- Circuit reproduces sarcasm detection behavior with >80% fidelity\n",
      "- Total write budget ≤ 11,200 dimensions  \n",

      "\n",
      "### Hypotheses to Test\n",
      "1. Early layers encode literal sentiment → **TESTABLE**: attention to positive words\n",
      "2. Middle layers detect incongruity → **TESTABLE**: differential activation on sarcastic sentences\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Original Hypothesis\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Function**: Propagate and refine sarcasm signal from m2\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Stage 3: Final Integration (L8-L11)\n",
      "**Critical MLPs**: m8, m9, m10, m11 (write cost: 768 dims each)\n",

      "- **Function**: Final processing of sarcasm signal\n",
      "- **Evidence**: Increasing differential activation (11-22 range)\n",

      "\n",
      "**Critical Attention Heads**: a11.h8, a11.h0 (write cost: 64 dims each)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Function**: \"Output heads\" that integrate processed signal into final representation\n",

      "### Circuit Composition\n",
      "\n",
      "**Total Components**: 54\n",

      "- Concentration in L11: 5 heads including two most important\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sarcasm detection is early**: Network \"decides\" at L2 whether text is sarcastic\n",
      "2. **Not sentiment reversal**: Later layers don't flip polarity but integrate early detection\n",
      "3. **Distributed circuit**: 43 attention heads suggest information routing across positions\n",
      "4. **Hierarchical processing**: Early detection → middle propagation → late integration\n",
      "\n",
      "### Comparison to Original Predictions\n",
      "\n",
      "✓ **Correct**: Early layers important for initial processing  \n",
      "✗ **Incorrect**: Middle layers are primary detection site (actually L2)\n",
      "✓ **Correct**: Late layers critical for final output\n",
      "✗ **Incorrect**: Process is sentiment reversal (actually signal integration)\n",
      "✓ **Correct**: MLPs more important than attention heads\n",
      "\n",
      "### Validation Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "To validate this circuit, we would need to:\n",
      "1. **Ablation testing**: Remove components and measure impact on sarcasm detection\n",
      "2. **Intervention experiments**: Patch activations to test causal relationships  \n",
      "3. **Attention pattern analysis**: Verify information flow matches hypothesized stages\n",
      "4. **Probing**: Train linear probes to detect sarcasm signal at each layer\n",
      "\n",
      "### Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Small dataset**: Only 5 paired examples analyzed\n",
      "2. **Synthetic data**: Real-world sarcasm may have different patterns\n",
      "3. **Differential activation ≠ causation**: High differential doesn't guarantee causal importance\n",
      "4. **No behavioral testing**: Haven't verified circuit actually reproduces sarcasm detection\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps for Phase 3\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Expand analysis to all 20 sarcastic examples\n",
      "2. Perform systematic ablation experiments\n",
      "3. Analyze attention patterns in detail for key heads\n",
      "4. Test circuit on held-out examples\n",
      "5. Potentially prune circuit further based on ablation results\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The sarcasm circuit in GPT2-small appears to be a **three-stage hierarchical system** with early detection (m2), distributed propagation (mid-layer MLPs and attention), and final integration (late MLPs and L11 attention heads). This differs from our initial hypothesis in timing (earlier detection) and mechanism (integration rather than reversal).\n",

      "2. **Larger dataset**: Analyze all 40 examples, ideally real-world data\n",
      "3. **Iterative pruning**: Remove least important components, test fidelity\n",

      "\n",
      "This codebase implements a differential activation analysis pipeline for circuit discovery in transformers. The key innovation is using paired examples (sarcastic vs. literal) to identify components that specialize in sarcasm detection. The resulting 54-component circuit reveals a three-stage hierarchical process with early detection (m2), distributed propagation, and final integration (Layer 11 heads).\n",
