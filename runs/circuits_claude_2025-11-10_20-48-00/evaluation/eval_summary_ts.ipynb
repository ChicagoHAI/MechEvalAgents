    "### Immediate Priority (Required)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Behavioral Validation**\n",
    "   - Implement circuit-only forward pass\n",
    "   - Evaluate on sarcasm detection task\n",
    "   - Compare to full model baseline\n",
    "   - Target: >80% fidelity to full model\n",

    "   - Consider real-world sarcasm dataset (mib-bench/sarcasm)\n",
    "   - Test generalization to held-out examples\n",

    "\n",
    "The student demonstrated **excellent planning skills** and **proper methodology** for exploratory circuit analysis. However, they **critically failed** to complete the most important requirement: **validating that the circuit actually performs sarcasm detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work represents a good first step (differential activation analysis) but stops before the essential validation steps (ablation, behavioral testing, pruning). The circuit may or may not work for sarcasm detection - **we simply don't know** because it was never tested.\n",

    "### Key Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "In mechanistic interpretability research:\n",
    "- **Correlation ≠ Causation**\n",
    "- Differential activation shows components respond differently, NOT that they're functionally important\n",
    "- **Validation is mandatory**: Circuits must be tested behaviorally and causally, not just identified by correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not accept this work as complete.** The student must:\n",
    "1. Perform behavioral validation (circuit-only model)\n",
    "2. Conduct ablation studies\n",
    "3. Validate or revise component interpretations\n",
    "4. Prune to minimal circuit\n",

    "Only then can we determine if a \"sarcasm circuit\" was actually discovered.\n",
