    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Identify circuit in GPT2-small for sarcasm detection  \n",
    "**Method**: Differential activation analysis  \n",
    "**Result**: 54-component circuit (10 MLPs, 43 attention heads)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ What Worked\n",
    "- m2 (MLP Layer 2) identified as highest differential activation component\n",
    "- Bimodal MLP pattern: Early (L0-2) + Late (L7-11)  \n",
    "- Top attention heads: a11.h8, a11.h0\n",
    "- Budget constraint met: 11,200/11,200 dimensions\n",

    "| Issue | Severity | Description |\n",
    "|-------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| No behavioral testing | HIGH | >80% fidelity criterion never tested |\n",
    "| Overstatement | MEDIUM | \"45% stronger\" claim actually ~27% |\n",
    "| No causal analysis | HIGH | Activation ≠ causation |\n",
    "| Limited data | LOW | Only 5/20 pairs analyzed |\n",

    "## Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "**The project successfully identifies a plausible candidate circuit but fails to validate that it actually performs sarcasm detection.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verdict: PARTIALLY COMPLETE\n",
    "\n",
    "The identified circuit (centered on m2 and L11 attention heads) should be treated as a **hypothesis requiring further validation**, not a confirmed finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Must Do**: Run ablation experiments to test circuit fidelity\n",
    "2. **Should Do**: Analyze full dataset (all 20 pairs)  \n",
    "3. **Could Do**: Train linear probes for mechanistic verification\n",
