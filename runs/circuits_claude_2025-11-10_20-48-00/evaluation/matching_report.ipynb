    "\n",
    "### Missing Validations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Behavioral Testing**\n",
    "   - The >80% fidelity criterion was never tested\n",
    "   - No experiments showing circuit actually performs sarcasm detection\n",
    "   - No ablation studies to verify causal importance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Causal Analysis**\n",
    "   - Activation patching was planned but not completed\n",
    "   - Differential activation shows correlation only\n",
    "   - Cannot conclude that identified components \"cause\" sarcasm detection\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limited Dataset Usage**\n",
    "   - 20 sarcastic + 20 literal examples were available\n",
    "   - Only 5 pairs were analyzed in detail\n",
    "   - No held-out test set for validation\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Threshold Selection**\n",

    "   - No principled threshold for \"important\" components\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretation Without Evidence**\n",
    "   - Claims like \"m2 detects incongruity\" are speculative\n",
    "   - No mechanistic evidence for what components compute\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overstated Conclusions**\n",

    "The Sarcasm Circuit Analysis project represents a **reasonable first-pass analysis** that successfully identifies candidate circuit components. However, it falls short of its stated goals due to the absence of causal validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway**: The identified circuit (54 components, centered on m2 and L11 attention heads) is a plausible hypothesis, but should be considered a starting point for further investigation, not a validated finding.\n",
