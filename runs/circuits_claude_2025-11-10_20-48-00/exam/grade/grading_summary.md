## Detailed Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Perfect Multiple Choice Performance**: Student correctly answered all 9 multiple-choice questions, demonstrating solid comprehension of key concepts from the documentation.

2. **Excellent Code Implementation**: All 3 code-required questions received perfect scores:
   - Question 17: Successfully verified write budget calculation (11,200 dimensions)
   - Question 18: Correctly calculated and verified m2 is ~45% stronger than m11
   - Question 19: Accurately verified attention head distribution across layers

3. **Documentation Adherence**: No external references detected. All answers appear grounded in the provided documentation.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Free Generation Depth**: While free-generation answers contained relevant concepts, they lacked the depth and detail present in the gold answers. Average score of 3.14/5.0 suggests:
   - Answers could be more comprehensive
   - More specific examples and details from documentation would strengthen responses
   - Better integration of multiple concepts would demonstrate deeper understanding

2. **Elaboration**: Some answers were brief and could benefit from:
   - More thorough explanations of mechanisms
   - Better connection between different circuit components
   - More explicit references to specific sections of documentation

### External Reference Detection

- **External References Found**: 0
- **Assessment**: Student answers were appropriately grounded in the documentation without reliance on outside knowledge.
