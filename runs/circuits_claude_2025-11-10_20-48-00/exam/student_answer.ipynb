The mechanistic difference is that: (1) detection happens immediately at Layer 2, not gradually in middle layers; (2) middle layers propagate and refine the already-detected sarcasm signal rather than performing detection; (3) late layers integrate the signal into output rather than reversing sentiment polarity.

Given the budget-constrained selection algorithm described in the documentation, explain why this distribution occurred and what it implies about the relative importance of MLPs vs. attention for sarcasm detection.\n",

    "**Answer:** The distribution occurred because components were ranked by differential activation and selected top-down within the budget constraint. MLPs showed much higher differential activation (m2 at 32.47, top heads only ~3.33), so they were prioritized despite costing more dimensions (768 vs 64 each). This implies MLPs are fundamentally more important than attention for sarcasm detection - they perform the core incongruity detection computation, while attention heads play a supporting role in information routing and integration. The 2.8:1 dimension ratio (7,680:2,752) reflects this computational division of labor."
