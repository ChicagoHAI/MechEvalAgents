Perfect! I have successfully completed the large circuit tracing experiment for sarcasm detection in GPT2-small. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Experiment Summary

### Key Findings

1. **MLP Layer 2 (m2) is the dominant sarcasm detector** with differential activation of 32.47 - remarkably 45% stronger than the next strongest component. This reveals that sarcasm detection happens much earlier in the network (Layer 2) than initially hypothesized (Layers 4-7).

2. **Three-stage hierarchical circuit**:
   - **Early Detection (L0-L2)**: m2 performs primary incongruity detection
   - **Signal Propagation (L3-L7)**: Mid-layer MLPs and attention heads distribute and refine the signal
   - **Final Integration (L8-L11)**: Late MLPs and Layer 11 attention heads (especially a11.h8 and a11.h0) integrate into output

3. **Circuit composition**: 54 components using exactly 11,200 dimensions (100% budget utilization)
   - 10 MLPs (7,680 dims)
   - 43 attention heads (2,752 dims)
   - Input embedding (768 dims)

- **logs/plan_v1.md** - Initial hypothesis and experimental design
- **logs/plan_v2.md** - Refined hypothesis based on empirical findings
- **logs/documentation.md** - Comprehensive documentation covering goals, data, methods, results, analysis, and takeaways

- **logs/circuit_visualization.png** - Visual analysis of circuit components
- **notebooks/2025-11-10-20-48_SarcasmCircuitAnalysis.ipynb** - Complete Jupyter notebook with all analysis

### Methodology

Used **differential activation analysis** on paired sarcastic/literal examples to identify components that show the strongest difference in activation patterns. This revealed which parts of the network specialize in detecting the contradiction between literal sentiment and contextual tone that characterizes sarcasm.
