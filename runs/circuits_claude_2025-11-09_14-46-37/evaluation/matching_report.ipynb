    "### Objective\n",
    "Identify a precise circuit in GPT2-small that implements the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task while staying within a write budget of 11,200 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "The IOI circuit consists of three main components:\n",
    "1. **Duplicate Token Heads**: Attend from S2 to S1, signaling token duplication\n",
    "2. **S-Inhibition Heads**: Attend from END to S2, inhibiting attention to the subject\n",
    "3. **Name-Mover Heads**: Attend from END to IO, copying the indirect object to the output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "1. Load GPT2-small and IOI dataset\n",
    "2. Analyze attention patterns for each head type\n",
    "3. Select top-performing heads from each category\n",
