## Experiment Complete! ✓

I've successfully completed the IOI Circuit Analysis experiment. Here's what was accomplished:

### 📁 Deliverables Created

**1. Circuit File:**
- `real_circuits_1.json` - 44 nodes (31 attention heads + 12 MLPs + input)
- Exact budget usage: 11,200/11,200 dimensions (100% utilization)

**2. Documentation (`logs/`):**
- `plan.md` - Research methodology and approach
- `documentation.md` - Comprehensive results (9.1 KB)
- `code_walk.md` - Implementation walkthrough (11 KB)
- `circuit_visualization.png` - Head distribution and budget charts

**3. Jupyter Notebooks (`notebooks/`):**
- `2025-11-09-14-46_IOI_Circuit_Analysis.ipynb` - Full analysis (145 KB)
- `plan_Md.ipynb`, `documentation_Md.ipynb`, `code_walk_Md.ipynb`

### 🎯 Key Findings

**Circuit Composition by Function:**
- **Duplicate Token Heads**: 6 heads (e.g., a3.h0 with 0.72 avg attention S2→S1)
- **S-Inhibition Heads**: 12 heads (e.g., a8.h6 with 0.74 avg attention END→S2)
- **Name-Mover Heads**: 15 heads (e.g., a9.h9 with 0.80 avg attention END→IO)

**Performance:**
- Baseline model accuracy: 94% (94/100 examples)
- All validation checks: PASSED ✓

**Layer Distribution:**
- Early layers (0-3): Duplicate token detection
- Middle layers (7-8): Subject inhibition
- Late layers (9-11): Name moving & prediction

### ✅ Hypothesis Validation

The three-component IOI circuit hypothesis is **STRONGLY SUPPORTED**:
1. ✓ Duplicate Token Heads identified with strong S2→S1 attention
2. ✓ S-Inhibition Heads identified with strong END→S2 attention
3. ✓ Name-Mover Heads identified with strong END→IO attention

The circuit exhibits clear hierarchical processing matching the predicted information flow.

### 📊 All Constraints Satisfied

✓ All 44 nodes are valid (in src_nodes)
✓ Naming convention followed (a{layer}.h{head}, m{layer})
✓ Budget constraint met (exactly 11,200 dimensions)

The analysis notebook is saved at `notebooks/2025-11-09-14-46_IOI_Circuit_Analysis.ipynb` with all code, results, and visualizations.
