Title: Budget Constraint Verification and Component Analysis
Prompt: Write code to verify the budget constraint calculation. Given the final circuit composition (31 attention heads and 12 MLPs), compute the total dimensional write and verify it equals 11,200. Also calculate what percentage of the budget is used by attention heads vs MLPs.
Expected_Outcome: Total budget = 11,200 dimensions (verified). Attention heads: 1,984 dims (17.71%), MLPs: 9,216 dims (82.29%). Tolerance: exact match for total, ±0.01% for percentages.

Title: Layer Distribution Analysis of Attention Heads
Prompt: Write code to analyze the layer distribution of the 31 attention heads in the circuit. Count how many heads are in each layer (0-11) and identify which layer has the most heads. Then determine if there's a trend showing more heads in later layers.
Expected_Outcome: Layer distribution dict showing counts per layer. Layer 10 has the most heads (7 heads). Later layers (9-11) have 16 total heads vs early layers (0-3) having 7 heads, confirming a trend toward later layers. Tolerance: exact counts.

Title: Minimal Circuit Budget Calculation
Prompt: Write code to simulate what would happen if you wanted to create a minimal IOI circuit using only the top-1 head from each functional category (Duplicate Token: a3.h0, S-Inhibition: a8.h6, Name-Mover: a9.h9) plus all 12 MLPs. Calculate the total budget used and how much budget remains unused compared to the full circuit.
Expected_Outcome: Minimal circuit budget = 9,408 dimensions (3 heads × 64 + 12 MLPs × 768). Budget remaining = 1,792 dimensions. Compared to full circuit: 1,792 dimensions saved. Tolerance: exact match.
