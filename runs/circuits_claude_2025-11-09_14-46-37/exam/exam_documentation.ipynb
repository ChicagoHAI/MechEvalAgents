    "## Key Knowledge Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Before attempting the exam, ensure you understand these core concepts from the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Task Definition & Structure\n",
    "- **IOI Task**: Predict the indirect object at the end of a sentence with two names, one repeated\n",
    "- **Key Positions**: \n",
    "  - S1: First mention of subject\n",
    "  - S2: Second mention of subject  \n",
    "  - IO: Indirect object\n",
    "  - END: Final token position\n",
    "- **Example**: \"As Carl and Maria left the consulate, Carl gave a fridge to ___\" → Answer: Maria\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Three-Component Hypothesis\n",
    "1. **Duplicate Token Heads**: Attend from S2 → S1, detect token duplication\n",
    "2. **S-Inhibition Heads**: Attend from END → S2, inhibit subject attention\n",
    "3. **Name-Mover Heads**: Attend from END → IO, copy indirect object to output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Architecture (GPT2-small)\n",
    "- 12 layers, 12 heads per layer\n",
    "- d_model = 768, d_head = 64\n",
    "- Each attention head writes 64 dimensions\n",
    "- Each MLP writes 768 dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Write Budget Constraints\n",
    "- Total budget limit: ≤ 11,200 dimensions\n",
    "- Final circuit: 31 heads (1,984 dims) + 12 MLPs (9,216 dims) = 11,200 dims (100% utilization)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Key Findings\n",
    "- **Baseline accuracy**: 94% on 100 IOI examples\n",
    "- **Top heads identified**:\n",
    "  - Duplicate Token: a3.h0 (0.7191)\n",
    "  - S-Inhibition: a8.h6 (0.7441)\n",
    "  - Name-Mover: a9.h9 (0.7998)\n",
    "- **Layered processing**: Early layers detect patterns, middle layers inhibit, late layers predict\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Analysis Insights\n",
    "- Circuit exhibits clear functional specialization\n",
    "- Redundancy across multiple heads per category\n",
    "- Only 10.1% of total model capacity used (sparse subcircuit)\n",
    "- Strong empirical support for three-component hypothesis\n"
