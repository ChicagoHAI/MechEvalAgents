    "# IOI Circuit Analysis - Research Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify a precise circuit in GPT2-small that implements the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task while staying within a write budget of 11,200 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The IOI circuit consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duplicate Token Heads**: Attend from S2 to S1, signaling token duplication\n",
    "2. **S-Inhibition Heads**: Attend from END to S2, inhibiting attention to the subject\n",
    "3. **Name-Mover Heads**: Attend from END to IO, copying the indirect object to the output\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Data Exploration\n",
    "- Load GPT2-small model via TransformerLens\n",
    "- Load mib-bench/ioi dataset\n",
    "- Analyze dataset structure and identify key positions (S1, S2, IO, END)\n",
    "- Establish baseline model performance on IOI task\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Attention Pattern Analysis\n",
    "- Run model with activation caching\n",
    "- For each layer and head, calculate attention patterns:\n",
    "  - **Duplicate Token Heads**: Measure attention from S2 → S1\n",
    "  - **S-Inhibition Heads**: Measure attention from END → S2\n",
    "  - **Name-Mover Heads**: Measure attention from END → IO\n",
    "- Rank heads by their alignment with hypothesized behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Circuit Selection\n",
    "- Select top-k heads from each category\n",
    "- Include supporting MLPs from relevant layers\n",
    "- Ensure total write budget ≤ 11,200 dimensions\n",
    "  - Each head writes: d_model / n_heads = 768 / 12 = 64 dims\n",
    "  - Each MLP writes: d_model = 768 dims\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Validation\n",
    "- Verify all nodes are in allowed src_nodes\n",
    "- Verify naming conventions (a{layer}.h{head}, m{layer})\n",
    "- Verify budget constraints\n",
    "- Document circuit composition and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A JSON file (real_circuits_1.json) containing the selected circuit nodes\n",
    "- Comprehensive documentation of findings\n",
    "- Validation that the circuit stays within budget\n",
    "- Analysis of whether findings support the IOI hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Circuit contains ≤ 11,200 dimensional writes\n",
    "2. All nodes follow naming conventions\n",
    "3. Circuit includes representatives from all three hypothesized head types\n",
    "4. Documentation clearly explains methodology and results\n"
