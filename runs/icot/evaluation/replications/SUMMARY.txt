Experiment: Linear Regression Probing for Intermediate Values (ĉk)

================================================================================
OVERALL RESULT
================================================================================

Replication Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS
Replication Score:  2.8/5 (56%)

Scores by Criterion:
  A. Implementation Reconstructability:  3/5 (60%)
  B. Environment Reproducibility:        2/5 (40%)
  C. Result Fidelity:                    1/5 (20%)
  D. Determinism/Seed Control:           4/5 (80%)
  E. Error Transparency:                 4/5 (80%)

================================================================================
WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
================================================================================

✅ Successfully loaded ICoT model (2L4H, 214MB checkpoint)
✅ Processed 1000 multiplication problems from validation set
✅ Computed ground truth ĉk values (running sums) for all samples
✅ Verified model architecture (2 layers, 4 heads, 768-dim)
✅ Established complete replication framework
✅ Created comprehensive documentation (3 markdown files)
✅ Identified specific technical blockers with root cause analysis

================================================================================
WHAT WAS NOT ACHIEVED
================================================================================

❌ Could not extract activations from hooked model (API incompatibility)
❌ Could not train/evaluate linear probes (missing activations)
❌ Could not obtain MAE metrics for ICoT vs SFT comparison
❌ Could not validate digit-wise probe performance
❌ Could not reproduce paper figures quantitatively

================================================================================
PRIMARY TECHNICAL BLOCKERS
================================================================================

1. Hook Infrastructure Incompatibility
   Error: IndexError: tuple index out of range
   Location: record_activations() -> model.forward()
   Impact: Cannot extract hidden states for probe training

2. Custom Generation API
   Error: ImplicitModel.generate() unexpected keyword arguments
   Impact: Cannot use standard generation patterns

3. Missing Environment Specification
   Issue: No requirements.txt or version pinning
   Impact: Difficult to diagnose environment-specific issues

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

Positive:
  • Experiment design is scientifically rigorous and well-motivated
  • Code is generally well-organized and understandable
  • Documentation (code_walkthrough.md) is comprehensive
  • Methodology is clearly described in paper

Negative:
  • Custom infrastructure creates reproducibility barriers
  • Non-standard APIs add implementation complexity
  • Missing dependency specifications complicate debugging
  • External checkpoint storage requires extra setup

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Future Replicators:
  1. Start by debugging hook infrastructure
  2. Verify all library versions match expectations
  3. Consider alternative activation extraction methods
  4. Contact authors for known workarounds

For Original Authors (Priority Order):
  1. ⭐ Provide requirements.txt with exact versions
  2. ⭐ Include minimal working example (< 50 lines)
  3. ⭐ Host checkpoints in repository or provide download
  4. 📝 Document custom API signatures explicitly
  5. 🧪 Add unit tests for critical functions
  6. 🐛 Create troubleshooting guide
