    "According to the documentation, the ICoT model for 4×4 multiplication uses a 2-layer, 4-head architecture. The key mechanisms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attention Tree Structure:** Layer 1 caches pairwise products aibj, Layer 2 retrieves them\n",
    "2. **Computational Depth:** For output digit ck, the model needs to compute and aggregate O(k) partial products\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** For 6×6 digit multiplication, the model would likely require additional layers (3-4 layers instead of 2) to handle deeper dependency chains, as the binary attention tree would need more depth to cache and retrieve the increased number of partial products. Additionally, more attention heads (6-8 heads instead of 4) would be beneficial to parallelize the computation of multiple partial products simultaneously. The embedding dimension might need to increase to accommodate richer representations of the longer intermediate sums. Since 2L4H is the minimal architecture for 4×4, and 6×6 has 50% more complexity in both dimensions, a proportional scaling to 3-4 layers and 6-8 heads would be a reasonable prediction."

    "According to Section 4 (Results - Geometric Representations - Fourier Basis Embeddings), the documentation describes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3D PCA Structure:**\n",
    "- PC1: Parity vector p(n), separating even/odd digits\n",
    "- PC2-PC3: k=2 Fourier pair, forming two regular pentagons\n",
    "- Result: Pentagonal prism geometry with parallel pentagons for even/odd digits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this geometry emerges:**\n",
    "The Fourier basis representation uses frequencies k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 5}:\n",
    "Φ(n) = [1(n), cos(2πn/10), sin(2πn/10), cos(2πn/5), sin(2πn/5), p(n)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The k=2 Fourier components (cos(2πn/5), sin(2πn/5)) naturally create a regular pentagon when plotting digits 0-9, since this frequency has period 5 and there are 10 digits (two cycles). The parity vector p(n)=(-1)ⁿ separates even and odd digits, creating two parallel pentagonal structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation notes: \"The SFT model shows no clear geometric structure in 3D PCA,\" highlighting that this emerges specifically from successful ICoT training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The pentagonal prism geometry consists of two parallel regular pentagons in 3D space. PC1 represents the parity vector p(n)=(-1)ⁿ that separates even and odd digits into two parallel planes. PC2-PC3 represent the k=2 Fourier pair (cos(2πn/5), sin(2πn/5)), which creates regular pentagon shapes because this frequency has period 5 and cycles twice through the 10 digits. This geometry emerges because the ICoT model learns to represent digits using Fourier bases optimized for modular arithmetic, where the period-5 structure aligns with the mod-10 arithmetic of decimal digits."

    "1. **Scaling doesn't help (Section 4):** \n",
    "   - 2L4H SFT: < 1% accuracy\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Same architecture succeeds with different training (Section 4):**\n",
    "   - ICoT with 2L4H: 100% accuracy\n",
    "   - This proves 2L4H has sufficient capacity; the issue is how it's trained\n",
    "\n",

    "   - SFT models don't develop attention trees or encode ĉk values\n",
    "   - \"Model never learns the long-range dependencies needed for middle digits\"\n",
    "   - These structures can fit in 2L4H (as ICoT proves), but gradient descent doesn't discover them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A capacity problem means the model lacks sufficient parameters to represent the solution, while an optimization problem means the model has adequate capacity but training fails to find the right solution. The evidence that SFT fails due to optimization rather than capacity is: (1) Scaling from 2L4H to 12L8H produces identical <1% accuracy, (2) ICoT achieves 100% accuracy with the same 2L4H architecture, proving sufficient capacity exists, (3) Gradient analysis shows SFT converges to local optima learning only first/last digits while middle digit loss plateaus, and (4) SFT models never develop the attention tree structures and ĉk encodings that fit within the same architecture when trained with ICoT. The problem is that standard gradient descent with autoregressive loss cannot discover the required computational structures."

    "\n",
    "**Question:** Write code to replicate the linear probe experiment that demonstrates ICoT models encode the running sum ĉₖ in their hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should:\n",
    "1. Load the ICoT model and extract hidden states at layer 2 mid-point (after attention, before MLP)\n",
    "2. For a validation set of 200 multiplication problems, extract hidden states at the timestep where cₖ is being computed (for k=2,3,4)\n",
    "3. Compute the ground truth ĉₖ values (sum of all partial products with indices ≤ k plus any carry)\n",
    "4. Train a simple linear regression probe (using sklearn or torch) to predict ĉₖ from the hidden states\n",
    "5. Evaluate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a held-out test set of 100 problems\n",
    "6. Print the MAE for each k ∈ {2,3,4}\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected outcome: MAE should be low (<5.0) for all three positions, demonstrating that ĉ values are linearly decodable from hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "According to the documentation, the ICoT model encodes intermediate running sums ĉₖ in its hidden states, and these can be decoded with low MAE (0.56-2.00). I need to extract hidden states, compute ground truth running sums, train linear probes, and measure prediction accuracy."

    "### Question 19 - Code: Fourier Basis Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Write code to compute the R² fit of the Fourier basis representation for digit embeddings in the ICoT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should:\n",
    "1. Load the ICoT model and extract the embedding matrix for digits 0-9\n",
    "2. Construct the Fourier basis matrix Φ with frequencies k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 5}:\n",
    "   - Column 0: constant (all 1s)\n",
    "   - Columns 1-2: cos(2πn/10), sin(2πn/10) for n=0..9\n",
    "   - Columns 3-4: cos(2πn/5), sin(2πn/5) for n=0..9  \n",
    "   - Column 5: parity p(n) = (-1)ⁿ for n=0..9\n",
    "3. For each dimension d in the embedding (768 dims), extract the vector x_d of length 10 (values for digits 0-9)\n",
    "4. Fit coefficients: C_d = argmin_C ||x_d - ΦC||²\n",
    "5. Compute R² = 1 - ||x_d - ΦC_d||² / ||x_d - mean(x_d)||²\n",
    "6. Report the median R² across all embedding dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected outcome: Median R² should be high (>0.80), confirming Fourier basis structure in embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "The documentation states that the ICoT model uses Fourier bases with frequencies k ∈ {0,1,2,5} to represent digits, achieving median R² of 0.84 for embeddings. I need to extract embeddings, construct the Fourier basis, fit coefficients, and compute R² values."
